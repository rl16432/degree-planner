# Degree Planner

> [!NOTE]
> **Degree Planner is not actively developed or supported.** Degree Planner is a project born from a 2023 university assignment, whose deadline has long passed. The original contributing teams have no plans to continue development efforts. Pull requests are welcome, but we encourage you to frame it as an exercise for personal and professional development‚Äîwithout expectation that Degree Planner will see ‚Äúreal-world‚Äù use.

A website for potential or current University of Auckland students to view the list of courses available at the university and plan their degree or trial other potential degrees to their interest.

Degree Planner will assist potential tertiary education students in selecting their future degree at the University of Auckland and also help current students in assuring they will not deviate from their desired path until graduation.

## ü´µ How you can contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing to degree planner! There are plenty of ways to help us build Degree Planner, only part of which is has to involve writing code. You could help us by providing feedback, reporting bugs, writing documentation, testing, helping with design, or suggesting features and changes you‚Äôd like to see.

It can be daunting to contribute to a project you aren‚Äôt familiar with. Simply using Degree Planner is a good place to start, and if you‚Äôve got some ideas to contribute, check out our [contributing guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [code of conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Happy contributing!

## üçî Technology stack

Degree Planner is a React-based web app built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), backed by a [Supabase](https://supabase.com) data store.

It also uses the University of Auckland‚Äôs [Course Catalog Api&nbsp;V3](https://developer.auckland.ac.nz/prd/documentation/api-course-catalog-v3). Access to this API will require a University of Auckland account. If you have ever applied, studied or worked at the University of Auckland, you should already have an account. Otherwise, to sign up:

1. Visit the [University of Auckland website](https://www.auckland.ac.nz).
2. Click **Sign In**.
3. Click **Register for a new account**, and follow the instructions from there.

## üöÄ Deploying locally

### Prerequisite

We suggest using [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (nvm) to ensure you have and use the version of Node.js needed by our code.

```sh
# If you use Homebrew
brew install nvm
```

Windows users: nvm needs to be run through [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) (WSL).

### Step¬†1: Clone the repo

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SOFTENG310-G7/degree-planner.git

# Navigate to its root
cd degree-planner/
```

If you are contributing code, then [create a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) of this repository and clone that instead. We use the [fork and pull model](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models) to accept code contributions from the community.

### Step¬†2: Install Node.js

Use the appropriate version of Node.js (specified in the [`.nvmrc`](/.nvmrc) file). If you don‚Äôt have an installation of the right version, it will ask you to run `nvm install`.

```sh
# Use the appropriate version of Node.js
nvm use
```

### Step 3: Install dependencies

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Step 3: Set environment variables

Create an `.env.local` file in the root directory of your clone and insert your API keys for [Supabase](https://supabase.com) and the University of Auckland [Course Catalog Api&nbsp;V3](https://developer.auckland.ac.nz/prd/documentation/api-course-catalog-v3):

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=

UOA_CLIENT_ID=
UOA_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

The first three can be obtained from the properties of your Supabase instance.

The last two API keys need to be generated from the [University of Auckland Developer Portal](https://developer.auckland.ac.nz):

1. Log into the [University of Auckland Developer Portal](https://developer.auckland.ac.nz) with your University of Auckland account.
2. Go to [your dashboard](https://developer.auckland.ac.nz/prd/dashboard) (accessible by hovering over your username/email in the header, and clicking **Dashboard**).
3. Under the *API Credentials* section, click **CREATE API CREDENTIAL**.
4. In the modal which appears, give the credentials a name (e.g.¬†`Degree Planner`). Leave the *‚ÄåClient\_id* and *Client\_secret* fields empty.
5. Click **CREATE API CREDENTIAL**. This will generate your `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` keys, which you can copy and paste into your `/.env.local` file.

> [!NOTE]
> If you get `400 Bad Request` when trying to access the University of Auckland Developer portal, try using private/incognito browsing, or clearing `auckland.ac.nz`‚Äôs cookies in your browser settings.

In the root directory, there is [a (non-functional) example](/.env.local.example) of what your env file should look like.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do **not** commit env files to version control. Git has been [configured to ignore it](.gitignore).

### Step 4: Good to go!

```sh
# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Look for a line similar to `ready started server on [::]:3000, url: http://localhost:3000`. In this example, you can then load <http://localhost:3000> in your web browser to start using Degree Planner (though the port number may not always be `3000`). Press <kbd>‚åÉ</kbd><kbd>C</kbd> (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>) in this window to terminate the server.

### Additional tools

This project is configured with [Prettier](https://prettier.io) to ensure a consistent code style. If you are contributing code, then we recommend you:

- configure your code editor to use the Prettier extension; and
- enable your editor‚Äôs *format on save* option.

This will help improve the speed and quality of code reviews. The following npm commands may be useful for verifying that your code is consistently formatted with the rest of the project:

```sh
# Run Prettier to format source code
npm run format

# Run Prettier locally to check if code will pass PR checks
npm run check-formatting
```
